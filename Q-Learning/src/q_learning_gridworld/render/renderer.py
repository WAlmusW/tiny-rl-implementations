"""Minimal Tkinter grid renderer (kept minimal & compatible with the DQN renderer).

This module provides a tiny visualization utility for the GridWorld environment.
It's intentionally lightweight so training can run headless when tkinter is not
available (e.g., on CI or headless servers). When GUI rendering is desired, the
GridRenderer opens a simple Tkinter window and draws:
  - grid cells,
  - pits (red squares),
  - goal (green square),
  - agent (blue circle),
  - a status text line with episode/step/return/epsilon/size.

Behavioral notes
----------------
- The module tries to import tkinter at top-level. If tkinter is missing (common
  in headless environments), the `tk` symbol is set to None and attempting to
  instantiate GridRenderer raises a RuntimeError. This lets calling code choose
  whether to attempt GUI creation or fall back to headless behavior.
- The renderer's `draw()` method calls Tkinter's update loop (`update_idletasks` +
  `update`) to push frames to the window. It optionally sleeps between frames to
  slow down rendering for visualization.

            - The method clears and redraws everything each frame which is simple

              drawing would be more efficient.
            - Colors and margins are chosen for clear visual contrast; they can be
              adjusted easily if you want a different look.
